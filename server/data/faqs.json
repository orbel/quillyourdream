    "question": "How should I care for my paper quilling artwork?",
    "answer": "Paper quilling art is delicate and should be treated with care. Display your piece away from direct sunlight to prevent fading. Avoid humid environments and areas prone to moisture. Dust gently with a soft, dry brush or use compressed air from a distance. Never use water or cleaning solutions. When framed properly with UV-protective glass, your artwork can last for generations.",
